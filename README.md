# AWS GuardDuty Threat Alerts

This project uses AWS GuardDuty to detect suspicious activities in an AWS account and sends real-time email alerts through SNS and EventBridge.

# What This Project Does

1) Simulates threat findings using aws guardduty create-sample-findings

2) Detects activities like port scans, account compromise, or unusual API calls

3) Sends real-time alerts via Amazon SNS to subscribed email addresses

4) Uses Amazon EventBridge to route findings from GuardDuty to SNS

# Summary

This project showcases how to build an automated threat detection and alerting pipeline using AWS GuardDuty, Amazon SNS, and EventBridge. By simulating threat activity, configuring real-time alert rules, and integrating email notifications, it demonstrates a practical approach to cloud security monitoring.

From setting up GuardDuty detectors to receiving live email alerts for suspicious behavior, every step is illustrated with CLI commands and real AWS Console screenshots‚Äîmaking it easy to replicate, learn, and apply in real-world AWS environments.
